The character set above specifies a conservative 64-character alphabet
with visually confusing characters removed. With 4-character passcodes,
each passcode has an effective "bit strength" of 24-bits and 16,777,216
passcodes are possible. This is the equivalent of what version 1 and 2
of the PPP system produced.

The character set specification below is a more "visually aggressive"
(and somewhat more interesting and certainly stronger) 88-character
alphabet with 25.836 effective bits of passcode strength and,
significantly, 59,969,536 possible 4-character passcodes ... so many
more than with the smaller but more conservative 64-character alphabet:

!"#$%&'()*+,-./23456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHJKLMNOPRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_abcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~

Other PPP specifications:

This alphabet comes a close as possible to 32-bit of passcode strength
(31.960 bits) with short (5-character) passcodes and therefore affords
a great deal of security by offering 4,182,119,424 (nearly four billion)
possible passcodes:

1234567890-=!@#$%&*()_+qwertyuiop[]QWERTYUIOP{}asdfghjklASDFGHJKL:zxcvbnmZXCVBNM<>?~

This achieves exactly 32-bits of passcode strength by using a simple
16-character alphabet but longer, 8-character passcodes:

ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP
